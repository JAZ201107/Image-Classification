# PyTorch Image Classification

Image Classification using:

- Convolution Neural Network from scratch
- Pre-trained Dense Net
- Pre-trained Google Net
- Pre-trained Res Net
- Vision Transformer from scratch

The purpose of this project is getting familiar with training a Neural Network, including:

- pre-process images
- define a dataloader
- define a model
- experiment tracking
